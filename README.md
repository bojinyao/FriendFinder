# FriendFinder - [Deployed on Heroku](https://morning-fjord-72040.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
A small Full Stack app for people to find friends. It asks 10 questions where user selects a score for each question. Once the user answers all questions, a simple integer normalizer will be used to calculate "closest fit" (pls don't take the result seriously). \
The app uses server side storage by writing to files, so no database is used.
